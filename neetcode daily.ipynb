    "## Algorithm Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Initialize Variables\n",
    "- `lp` (left pointer) is set to the beginning of the list (`0`).\n",
    "- `rp` (right pointer) is set to the end of the list (`len(heights) - 1`).\n",
    "- `max_area` is initialized to `0` to store the maximum area found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Two-Pointer Approach\n",
    "- The algorithm uses a `while` loop to iterate as long as `lp` is less than or equal to `rp`.\n",
    "- In each iteration:\n",
    "  - **Calculate Width**: `width` is the distance between `lp` and `rp`, calculated as `rp - lp`.\n",
    "  - **Calculate Height**: `height` is the minimum of the heights at `lp` and `rp` because the water level can only go as high as the shorter line.\n",
    "  - **Calculate Area**: `ar` is the area between `lp` and `rp`, calculated as `width * height`.\n",
    "  - **Update Maximum Area**: If `ar` is greater than `max_area`, update `max_area` with `ar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Move the Pointer\n",
    "- To try and find a potentially larger area, the pointer at the shorter line is moved inward:\n",
    "  - If `heights[lp]` (left height) is less than `heights[rp]` (right height), increment `lp` by 1 to consider a possibly taller line on the left side.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, decrement `rp` by 1 to consider a possibly taller line on the right side.\n",
    "- This adjustment is based on the idea that moving the pointer at the shorter line may help achieve a greater area in future iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Return the Result\n",
    "- Once `lp` and `rp` meet, the loop exits, and the maximum area found is returned as `max_area`.\n"
